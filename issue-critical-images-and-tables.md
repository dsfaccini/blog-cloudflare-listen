# Images and tables in blog posts

Our current code seems to be ignore images and tables found in blog posts.

We need to adjust the code to display the images where they should be, we already do that well with <a> tags.

For the tables we need new code, I've created [a new sample](./article-sample-with-table.html) for a harder article that has lots of images and a table to implement this change.
