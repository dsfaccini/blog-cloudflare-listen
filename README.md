# Blog Cloudflare Listen

A website where users can listen or read a summary of a cloudflare blog post.

At this moment, the narration of the articles can be improved a lot.

The images and tables of the articles are missing as well.

This website was just an experiment to implement a feature I was interested in using only the cloudflare stack.
